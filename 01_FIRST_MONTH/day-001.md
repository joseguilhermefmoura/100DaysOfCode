# DAY 001 

Here are the list of things I did in my day as programmer:

1 - Read the docs of **Django** and started a <a href="https://github.com/joseguilhermefmoura/Modern-Django-Blog" target="_blank">Modern Blog project</a> using the Framework.

2 - Read the docs of **Leaflet** and did it's quick-start tutorial.

3 - Started the <a href="https://github.com/joseguilhermefmoura/30-Days-of-React" target="_blank">30-Days-of-React</a> project, which took me some hours of solving lots of exercises and reading the **JavaScript** documentation.

4 - Updated <a href="https://github.com/joseguilhermefmoura" target="_blank">my profile README.md</a>.
